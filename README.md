## Welcome to our site about wildfires in the US. We've gathered data from a Kaggle dataset including 2.3 million fires in our country from 1992 to 2020. Continue scrolling for an in-depth study of whether or not fires have become larger or more spread in the last 30 years.

# As areas have increased in population, do we see a proportional increase in fires? 

### We chose to tackle this question since we are aware of the devastating effects of wildfires across the US. Our dataset is tied to geographical locations, and we had hypothesized that less populated areas would have larger fires. With less people in these areas, there would be a smaller amount of people in immediate danger, so to save human lives and resources, we theorized that they would let the fires burn, and thus spread over more acres. See below where we share our findings!

### Acres Burned (Top 10 States)

INSERT KATIE IMAGE

  * To begin, our first image shows total acreage burned across the top 10 states, across all years. Evidently, Alaska has had the most acres burned as a result of wildfires. This devastating range of fire damage only increased our curiosity of just how much worse fires are getting each year.

### Number of Fires (Average vs. Total )

INSERT JOSE'S IMAGE 

  * This graph shows the total number of wildfires and average fire size for each year, going from 1992 to 2020. When we say average fire size, we are talking about the average acreage a wildfire burns across. The purpose of this graph is to get a sense of whether wildfires are increasing each year, as well as to uncover if the wildfires are getting worse or burning more than before.

  * To analyze this, we used the Pearson Correlation Test to see if there is a relationship between time and number of fires/average fire size. When we ran the test, we found that there was not a statistically significant correlation between years and number of fires. However, when we ran the test with years and average fire size, we found a positive correlation between the two. Thus, we can conclude that as we’ve moved forward from 1992, there was no significant change in the total number of fires, but the average fire size has increased, which means that the fires are burning across more acres.

  * All things considered; this does not explain why the average fire has gotten worse from 1992. Continue scrolling to explore more possible causes of this trend!

### Top 10 Causes of Wildfires

INSERT PIE CHART IMAGE

  * Here we have a chart representing the Top 10 causes of wildfires in the United States. We can see here that debris and open burning make up about a quarter of wildfires in the United States. Two other leading causes are natural and arson, both at around 14%, which represent the two extremes of acceptability within the range of data. 

  * Other small causes include equipment and vehicle use, recreation or ceremony, misuse of fire by minors, smoking, railroad use, and power generation.

  * You can also see here that the plurality of data points to causes that are unknown, and indeed recently we can see that this number is higher even than the historical average. Although it was not the primary focus of our study, it should be noted that we did discuss the limitation in the data that many fires inevitably occur in areas of little or no population, as we will see in the heat map below. There are many reasons why local fire departments may hesitate to or be unable to extinguish these usually large fires that are away from settled or agricultural areas. Just a few include: 

    * The risk of life-threatening injuries to firefighters during the fire control process may be high. 

    * The infrastructure in local and regional fire departments might not support extinguishing large fires. 

    * The use of them might leave other populated areas vulnerable to emergencies. 

  * Wilderness wildfires in some instances are considered a part of the natural environmental process, necessary to the growth of native species, such as is the case with the longleaf pine of the coastal Southeast US. In all the above cases, we can see why the priority of fire departments might be to simply monitor, or at most control, large fires away from populated areas.

  * The point of the study was not to assume that every fire is “bad”, question why some large fires are left to burn. nor speculate the motive of each fire department across 30+ years of data. We want the data to speak for itself, but it’s important for the audience to know the limitations.

  * The data below will further support the assumptions that small fires often occur near human settlements, are often caused by humans, and are extinguished fairly quickly, while larger fires, which of course occur much less in frequency, often occur further from human settlement, have both human and natural causes (mostly natural), and grow much larger in size due to their distance from populated centers.

### Summary Statistics

INSERT PRATIK IMAGES

  * The count of fire is the same over years.

  * The average size in fire increased over years. 

  * The biggest "Cause" category in fire size is naturally caused fires

  * The largest fire size state in the top ten states, by land area.

  * The count of fires is highest in the human category, which might be driven by population. 

### Population Map

INSERT ANDREW IMAGE

  * When looking at the heat map, it is evident that fire growth is most intense in the western United States. As the size of fires increase out west, our curiosity was with population movements in those areas; and we’ve found some alarming trends. We looked at population density growth across the US from 1990 to 2020 to get a sense of where people are moving.

  * Then, we looked at those states with high rates of growth to see where they currently stand with population density in relation to the rest of the country. Three states stand out from this perspective: California, Texas, and Arizona. California, We think we all know, is a dense state, and fires have historically been an issue there. What is interesting to note is that California continues to grow, in population, at a moderate pace of 33%. That said, it is Texas and Arizona where the alarm bells are ringing loudest. There is a lot of red over these states on the heat map and both currently are relatively dense states at 112 and 63 people per square mile, respectively.

  * Most notably though, both states have seen substantial growth in 30 years, with Texas growing at a 72% clip and Arizona almost doubling over that period. If these trends continue, it’s safe to expect suburban and rural sprawl to bring people closer to fires.

  * What makes these numbers even more concerning is a link scientists in the Pacific Northwest are finding between Arctic ice melt and wildfires. In a nutshell: Ice melting in the arctic is causing a change in the jet stream that pushes very hot, dry air across the western United States, mostly in the fall—which are prime wildfire conditions during wildfire season.

  ### Heat Map & Summary

INSERT FIONA IMAGE

  * We started this analysis wanting to investigate what seems to be a pattern of worsening wildfires in the US. We thought this might be due to large fires in rural areas with low population, increasing numbers of fires, and larger fires overall.

  * As the data and analysis shows, we are not seeing more fires, but we are seeing larger average fires each year. All types of fires have gotten larger over time, but the increase is being driven primarily by natural causes, which is lightning in the US.

  * We also see a connection between rural land areas and large natural fires, but the population is growing in these areas, which is leading to increased devastation and human costs. So while humans are not starting these huge devastating fires, they are suffering from them. 

  * It would be interesting to follow this data over the next several years to see how population increases in previously rural areas, climate changes, and evolving fire management strategies will impact the size and number of fires we see as well as the toll they take on people.
